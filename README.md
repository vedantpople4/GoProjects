# Neural Network Implementation in Go

This repository contains an implementation of a neural network from scratch using Go. The network is designed to classify data, utilizing standard neural network techniques such as feedforward, backpropagation, and gradient descent.

## Features
- Neural Network Structure: A well-defined configuration for input, hidden, and output layers.
- Training the Network: Initializing weights and biases, and training the network using backpropagation.
- Backpropagation: Adjusting weights and biases based on the error between predicted and actual outputs.
- Accuracy Calculation: Evaluating the performance of the model by calculating its accuracy.

## Advantages of Using Go for Neural Networks
- **Performance:** Go is a statically typed, compiled language, which often results in faster execution times compared to Python’s interpreted nature.
- **Concurrency:** Go’s built-in support for concurrent programming with goroutines makes it easier to write highly concurrent applications, crucial for large-scale data processing.
- **Simplicity and Safety:** Go’s simplicity and strong type system reduce bugs and make the code easier to maintain and debug.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have Go installed on your machine.

### Setting Up Go
1. **Download and Install Go:**
   - Go to the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).
   - Download the appropriate installer for your operating system.
   - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

2. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Type the following command to verify the installation:
     ```sh
     go version
     ```
   - You should see output similar to `go version goX.X.X`, indicating that Go is installed correctly.

3. **Set Up Go Workspace:**
   - Create a directory for your Go workspace. For example:
     ```sh
     mkdir $HOME/go
     ```
   - Set the `GOPATH` environment variable to point to your workspace directory:
     - For Linux/macOS:
       ```sh
       export GOPATH=$HOME/go
       export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
       ```
     - For Windows:
       ```sh
       setx GOPATH "C:\path\to\your\workspace"
       setx PATH "%PATH%;%GOPATH%\bin"
       ```

### Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-network-go.git
cd neural-network-go
```

### Install Dependencies
Install the necessary Go packages:
```sh
go get -u gonum.org/v1/gonum/...
```

### Run the Neural Network
Run the neural network implementation:
```sh
go run main.go
```

## Directory Structure
- `main.go`: The main Go file containing the neural network implementation.
- `data/`: Directory containing training and testing data in CSV format.
